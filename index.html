                    <p>The history of bread spans thousands of years. Charred crumbs of flat bread-like remains were discovered in a Natufion site dated to be around 14,500 years old in Jordan's northeastern desert. It wasn't until the start of the Neolithic age, that grains became the way of making bread like we know today.</p>

                    <p>During the Neolithic time period around 6,000 years ago in prehistoric Egypt, evidence of breadmaking in the form of items and structures used for breadmaking, and even the remains of dough and bread itself were discovered.</p>

                    <p>Different forms of bread were also common in ancient Greece, differing from the bread we know today one of the most popular and common forms of bread was maza. Wheat bread was restricted to feast days but by the 5th century BC, bread had become commonplace with it being available for purchase at baker shops.</p>

                    <p>In medieval Europe, bread was extremely popular and common. It had many forms one of the most common forms called a trencher, a piece of bread shaped like a bowl that was served as a plate and was usually stale, it was often used as a part of table service. It wasn't until the 15th century that the bread trenchers were replaced by wood.</p>

                    <p>In the United States and England from the 18th century to the end of the 19th century, you would often find that the bread sold was contaminated with various hazardous materials such as chalk, sawdust, alum, plaster, clay, and ammonium carbonate. Bread sold in public bakehouses was among those that suffered from contaminated products however it was how most people would get bread. It wasn't until 1837 that Sylvester Graham published Treatise on Bread and Bread Making which describes how to make Graham bread using wheat flour, that people had an alternative to buying the contaminated bread. Eventually, this came to an end with the government taking action like Britain creating the Food Acts of 1860 and 1899, the United States had varying policies from various different states making it much harder for them to end the contamination.</p>

                    <p>Otto Frederick Rohwedder developed a prototype bread-slicing machine in 1912, and then in 1928 a machine that could do both slicing bread and wrap it, this is seen as the start of bread industrialization. The process used for germ discarding milling for bran and wheat grain during this time would extend the shelf life of the flour, it was discovered to also remove important nutrients, vitamins, and essential fatty acids. By 1941 the US government mandated the fortification of white flour-based food items with nutrients that were lost during the milling process in response to the large amount of nutrient deficiencies being found.</p>

                    <p>In more recent times chemical additives that can speed up the mixing time and reduce the fermentation time of the dough have become more common use, making it possible to make a batch of bread in less than 3 hours, multiple batches of bread could be made in a vastly shorter time period. These additives could accomplish various things such as making the dough easier to stretch and easier to handle, increasing the volume of the loaf, enhancing the crumb structure, and making the loaf softer. Commercial yeast was also created around this time marking a decline in the creation of sourdough.</p>
